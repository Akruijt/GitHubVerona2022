# Basic commands to use Git

## 0. Open a command line tool
- **Terminal** for Mac and Linux
- **Git BASH** for Windows (should have been installed together with Git)

## 1. Browse your computer

First, you need to be able to browse your computer, in order to find the folder you want to work with.  
1. To see where you are, you can use the command `pwd` (that reads: "print working directory")
2. To see the files/folders that are stored where you are, use `ls`
3. To move to another folder, use `cd my_folder`

### 1.1 Example

In a situation like the following:

To move from your location ("my_folder") to "my_other_folder", you need to write:

`cd my_other_folder`

## 2. Clone a repository

If you want to clone a repository by somebody else (or that you have created), you need to use the command: `git clone repository_url`

### 2.1 Example

If you want to clone **this** GitHub repository, you need to write:

`git clone https://github.com/SimoneRebora/GitHubVerona2022.git`

Note that the full url appears in the repository home page, top right:
