# Basic commands to use Git

## 0. Open a command line tool
- **Terminal** for Mac and Linux
- **Git BASH** for Windows (should have been installed together with Git)

## 1. Browse your computer

First, you need to be able to browse your computer, in order to find the folder you want to work with.  
1. To see where you are, you can use the command `pwd` (that reads: "print working directory")
2. To see the files/folders that are stored where you are, use `ls`
3. To move to another folder, use `cd my_folder`

### Example

In a situation like the following:

To move from your location ("my_folder") to "my_other_folder", you need to write:

`cd my_other_folder`
