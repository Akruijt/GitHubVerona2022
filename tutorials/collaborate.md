# Collaborate on GitHub

How to collaborate in developing GitHub repositories?

## Scenario 1

I note that something is missing/mistaken in a repository, but I do not have the knowledge (or time) to correct it

- I create an "Issue" in a repository, signalling it to the developer(s)
- It will be up to the person in charge of the repository to address my notification and in case solve the problem

## Scenario 2

I note that something is missing/mistaken in a repository, and **I do have** the knowledge (and time) to correct it

- I "fork" the repository and create a copy in my GitHub space
- I apply the changes to the repository in my GitHub space
- I send a "pull request"
- My pull request will be reviewed and, if fine, my forked repository will be merged with the source repository
